## Welcome!

This project simply includes a set of easily customizable scripts to automatically download, patch, build, and install the entire ARM toolchain (including `binutils`, `gcc`, `newlib`, and `openocd`). 

Currently the scripts only support the Cortex M3, Cortex M4, and Cortex M4F.

Support for other ARM cores can be added relatively easily.
